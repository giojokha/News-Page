    <p>People in Gaza are living through what is now the longest sustained telecoms internet disruption in the enclave since the start of the war with Israel, a monitoring site reports.

        A near-total internet blackout in the Gaza Strip has now passed 120 hours, according to Netblocks, with most residents unable to contact the outside world since January 12.
        
        On Monday, the Hamas-run government office in Gaza said the disruption also makes it harder for the emergency services that are still functioning to reach the wounded.</p>
