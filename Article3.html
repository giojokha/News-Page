    <p>A Maine judge on Wednesday told state election officials to wait for the US Supreme Court to rule on Donald Trumpâ€™s eligibility for the 2024 ballot. 

        Trump asked the judge to overturn a prior decision that removed him from the Maine ballot, but the judge declined to do that, and instead paused the proceedings until the Supreme Court weighs in.</p>
