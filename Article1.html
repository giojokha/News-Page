    <p>In other news, Putin said Tuesday it was “impossible” to take away from Russia the military gains it had made in Ukraine.

        Talking about possible peace talks, Putin said ideas put forward by Ukraine were “prohibitive formulas for the peace process.” When asked to comment on Sunday’s talks, the Kremlin’s Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov told CNBC, “We find these negotiations strange without our participation. They have no prospects for success.”</p>
